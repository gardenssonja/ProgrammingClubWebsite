        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            The Normanhurst Boys Programming Club is a student-led initiative dedicated to building coding skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. The club is about to provide a collaborative environment where students of all skills levels - from beginners to advanced programmers - can develop projects, learn new technologies, and support each other in their coding journey.
            We focus on hands-on learning through activities such as algorithm challenges, web development, game programming, cybersecurity, and participation in tech competitions.
